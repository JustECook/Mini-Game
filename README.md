# Mini-Game
Navigate the red ball to the green square

Instructions:
Use the cursor and controls to move the ball to the goal. 

Reason for Build:
This game is meant to help kids get comfortable with mouse navigation while having fun in the process. It was also built to help me understand how to make objects move in JavaScript

Future Upgrades:
1. Controls will accept keystrokes in addition to mouse clicks
2. Obstacles will block certain pathways
3. A countdown timer will be added
4. A point system will be created for added sense of accomplishment and competition
5. Arena will be enlarged

Potential upgrades:
Hidden squares that trigger new challenges
New levels that feature moving obstacles
Trap doors and portals to navigate to other parts of arena

As always, suggestions for improvements are welcome :)
